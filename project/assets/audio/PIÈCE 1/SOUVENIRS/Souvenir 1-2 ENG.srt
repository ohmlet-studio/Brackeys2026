1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,880
Oh, is that Koda's lighter?

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,740
He's been looking for it for so long!

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,880
We spent all our time partying and changing the world...

4
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:12,720
I told my parents I was going to study at his place 

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,000
so I wouldn't be at home too much.

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,300
Well, I remember we laughed a lot

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,790
but I admit I don't remember much else besides that.

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,660
We wasted a lot of our time and our youth, didn't we?

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,240
And then, well, we stopped seeing each other

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,020
after college, so sometimes I think to myself...

11
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,600
Was it all for this?
